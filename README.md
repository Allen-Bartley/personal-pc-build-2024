## 🛠️ Assembly Notes

- Used **iFixit Pro Tech Toolkit** for precision assembly, cable routing, and ESD-safe handling of components
- Routed all case fans using **PWM splitter cables** for optimal airflow control
- Installed memory and CPU using **ESD-safe trays and protective containers**
- Mounted dual monitors with **ErGear adjustable arms** for ergonomic workspace
- Added **under-desk headphone hanger** for cable management and accessibility

---

## 🧪 Testing & Optimization

- Updated BIOS to latest stable version for DDR5 and CPU support
- Enabled XMP profile for RAM to run at 5600MHz
- Tuned fan curves for quiet operation under load
- Verified thermal performance with Cinebench, HWMonitor, and FurMark
- Benchmarked SSD with CrystalDiskMark and confirmed NVMe speeds
- Used MemTest86 to validate RAM stability

---

## 📚 Lessons Learned

- Modular PSUs make cable management significantly easier
- BIOS updates are essential for DDR5 stability on 12th-gen Intel
- Push-pull CPU cooling improves airflow but requires careful RAM clearance planning
- Enterprise HDDs are loud but reliable—best used for cold storage or backups

---

## 🔭 Future Plans

- Add secondary NVMe SSD for scratch disk or Linux dual-boot
- Explore undervolting GPU for quieter operation
- Integrate UPS and power monitoring
- Document full cable routing and airflow diagram
